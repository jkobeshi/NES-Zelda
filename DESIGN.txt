a. pitch: implement new, simple mechanics which let the player handle 
enemies in different ways, and maneuver around new level hazards, 
even using them to your advantage in some cases. Our new custom levels mostly
focuses around puzzles and figuring out how to get to the next room using our
new weapon mechanic.

b. a grappling hook which lets the player move around enemies 
and certain blocks, which can be used in conjunction with the new 
trap tiles and pit found in the level. The grappling player allows us to reel
in enemies or certain blocks, allowing us to create an infinite possibility of
level mechanics

c. The grappling hook teaches the player to use pits and fragile tiles, 
which are normally hazardous to the player, to their advantage, as well as keeping 
players moving and playing less defensively, as staying in one area is riskier now.
This changes the way the game is played by creating a sense of urgency and management in
terms of which step the player should take next.

d. Players will have to pull certain blocks to protect themselves from the dangerous sliders,
as well as pulling enemies across pits or even dropping them in. These new mechanics forces
players to be careful of their next decision as making the wrong move can bite them in the back later.

e. Grappling hook can be used by pressing "z" after we have picked it up and the weapon is "OnHand".
When clicking "z", players movement is restricted if the Grappling hook has hooked a target. The
Player can then press the "Down Arrow Key" to reel the targets in. To release the hook, players
can simply recast "z".
